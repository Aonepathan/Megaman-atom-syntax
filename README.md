#Megaman Battle Network Syntax Theme

Based on my personal all-time favorite childhood video game, MegaMan Battle Network! This theme encapsulates the main color theme of MegaMan's Power Suit.

## Screenshot

Made for the Atom editor, it works fine with any Dark UI Theme package, One Dark in my opinion looks best.

## Color Palette

There are numerous colors from MegaMan's Power Suit, included in the colors.less file are all the colors from the suit. Some weren't used for this syntax theme, this gives the possibility to further edit the theme to your own hearts desire!
